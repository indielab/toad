# Toad notes

This is notes.md in the root of the repository.
I'm using this file to keep track of what works in Toad and what doesn't.

## What works

- Settings works (press `F2` or `ctrl+comma`)
- You can have a chat with the LLM.

## What is flakey

- Running code kinda works. Although it doesn't handle escape sequences.
- There's no way to interrupt the LLM output.
- Explain feature may be a bit flakey
